TODO list:
==========

Priority 1:
  V. Create yaml config by the web interface
    V. First version will handle client in workspace only
  Console App that will launch the config to start creating client in workspace
  Add client in Scratchpad


Priority 2:
  V. Create a minimal console that let the user create workspace/client with CLI interface
    (The CLI interface will never have as much features as the web interface due to my bash scripting level)
  Improve web interface
    - Second version will handle container and layout


Priority 3:
  Create a Bash script in order to not have PHP installed

Priority 4:


Priority 5:
  Full Drag&Drop UI to create your workspace
